HOME DIY App
A React-based web application to explore various DIY craft projects, add them to your favorites, and create a to-do list. The app is powered by a JSON server backend and supports client-side routing.


Features
1. Home Page
Browse DIY Projects: The home page serves as an entry point where users can browse various craft projects.
Introduction/Overview: Brief description or welcome message about what the app offers and how users can get started with exploring DIY projects.
2. Projects Page
View Detailed Project Information: Users can see a list of all available projects with details such as:
Project Name

    Add to Favorites: Users can click the ❤️ (heart) icon to mark a project as a favorite. The project will be saved to their Favorites page for easy access later.

3. Favorites Page
View Favorite Projects: Users can view all projects that they have marked as favorites from the Projects Page.
These are projects the user has expressed an interest in and wants to save for later reference.

4. To-Do List Page
Manage To-Do List: Users can add projects to a to-do list for future planning. This can help users organize projects they want to work on later.

5. User Interaction
Interactive Links: Navigation links like Home, Projects, To-Do List, and Favorites make it easy for users to move between different sections of the app.
6. Responsive Design
The app should be mobile-friendly. It will automatically adjust its layout to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
7. Search and Filter (Optional)
Depending on your project setup, users could search for specific projects based on:
Material Type (e.g., Paper, Wood, Fabric)
8. Integration with Backend
Live Data Fetching: The projects displayed on the site are fetched from the backend (JSON Server or Render API). This means users can see the most up-to-date content without needing to refresh the page.
